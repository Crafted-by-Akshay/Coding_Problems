Hint
Given an integer array nums, return the greatest common divisor of the smallest number and largest number in nums.

The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,5,6,9,10]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 2.
The largest number in nums is 10.
The greatest common divisor of 2 and 10 is 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [7,5,6,8,3]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 3.
The largest number in nums is 8.
The greatest common divisor of 3 and 8 is 1.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 3.
The largest number in nums is 3.
The greatest common divisor of 3 and 3 is 3.
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
------------------------
class Solution:
    def gcd(self, a,b):
        while b:
            a,b = b, a%b
        return a
    
    def findGCD(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        a = max(nums)
        b = min(nums)
        gcd = self.gcd(a,b)
        return gcd

Time Complexity
1. max(nums) and min(nums)

Each scans the list once.

Time: O(n) each

Combined: O(n)

2. gcd(a, b) (Euclidean Algorithm)

Runs in O(log(min(a, b)))

This is because each modulo operation reduces the number size significantly.

✅ Total Time Complexity
𝑂(𝑛+log𝑀)
O(n+logM)
	​


Where:

n = length of nums

M = maximum value in nums

Since log M is much smaller than n in most cases:

𝑂(𝑛)
O(n)
	​

Space Complexity

No extra data structures are used.

Only a few variables (a, b, gcd).

✅ Space Complexity
𝑂(1)
O(1)
	
Final Summary
Aspect	Complexity
Time	O(n + log M) → effectively O(n)
Space	O(1)
